# Driver-Drowsiness
This project built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python
as a backend language.The project includes direct
working with the 68 facial landmark detector and
also the face detector of the Dlib library. The 68
facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient
detector which detects the points on the human face
using which we determine whether the eyes are open
or they are closed
